## 1. Table (25 points)

Use HTML to create the irregular table shown below (10 points). You can find the picture of the vase [here](images/ming.jpg). All formatting must be done with CSS only. Please note – the entire table uses Arial font. The text in the table is centered.

* The heading “Exclusive Gifts for All Occasions” is created using the <caption> tag. The font size is XX-Large. The color is Navy. (2)

* The first row has the text shown in two lines. The text is italicized, bolded, and is centered within the row. The background for this cell is white. (2)

* The second row has the column headings. It has a yellow background (1)

* The other rows have silver or lime background as shown in the figure below (2)

* The image is centered within the cell. Center the image as best as you can and as close to how the image is shown in the table below (4). 

* The table has a width of 70% and is centered on the web page. Its border is 3px thick and is a black, solid border. The table has its top and bottom margins set to 10px. (2)  

* The cells have a 2px thick solid black border. (2)

* Save it as ```hw2-1.htm``` into folder ```homework```. You do not have to add link to this webpage in ```low.htm```.

## 2. Form (25 points)

Please build the following form, using a table. You can find the picture of soap [here](images/soap-1.jpg) and [here](images/soap-2.jpg). The following are the instructions for formatting and styling the web page. Each of these instructions below is worth 1 or 2 points (indicated by **) depending on the complexity. In addition, the design of the table is worth 4 points. 

* The background must be black. It must have a beaver image running along the bottom of the page and only along the bottom of the page. You should have the beaver image in your collection.

* The table must have a silver background. It must be centered on the page. It must have a fixed width (i.e., if the web page is reduced in size, the size and width of the table must not change).  

* Each radio button must appear on one line – i.e., within each set of radio buttons, each radio button and the label associated with it must be on the same line. Adjust column width to make this work.

* Each checkbox must appear on one line – i.e., within each set of checkboxes, each checkbox and the label associated with it must appear on the same line. Adjust column width to make this work.

* In the purchase intent column, the text label and the drop down menu must appear on two sequential lines. The options are: Definitely Buy, Likely Buy, Undecided, Unlikely Buy and Not Buy.  Since we are coding the data, when the form is completed and the data sent, we only need the values corresponding to the option choices above. The values range from 5 (Definitely Buy) to 1(Not Buy).

* For the personal information section, for Gender, the label and the drop down must be on the same line. The option values visible to the user are “Male” and “Female”. The coded data must translate these as “0” and “1” respectively.

* Age is a text box that is limited to 3 characters. The instructions for filling out the box must be shown with the label in the form. The width of the box is 5. 

* There is a text area that is defined to accept user comments. This area must fill out the cell from left to right. The label must be at the top and there will be some space at the top and at the bottom (i.e., the table background must be visible at the top and bottom of the text area).

* There are two buttons centered within the cell.

* The heading for the personal section “Tell us about yourself...” must be centered within the cell. This cell must have a white background.

* The title for the table must be in 3em font and white in color. It must be separated from the table by 30px.

* The column headings must appear exactly as shown in the figure below. 

* The images must be centered (left to right) within the cell. You don’t have to worry about centering top to bottom.

* The text area and the text box must have a yellow background color.

* The “Oops” button must have a red background color (though that is not shown in the figure below).

* Save it as ```hw2-2.htm``` into folder ```homework```. You do not have to add link to this webpage in ```low.htm```.
